Python Image Encryption - README

AUTHOR:  Cahlen Humphreys (phku)

THANKS:   #blacksun on eris free, and Tilar.

DESCRIPTION:  

A simple image encryption program written completely in python.  You simply run
 the program 'python imencrypt.py' and enter your desired password to encrypt 
of decrypt the image.  After you choose your password, choose either encrypt or
 decrypt, and an file browser will show up.  From here you can choose either 
the image to encrypt, or the image to decrypt with your given password.

HOW TO RUN:

python imencrypt.py

REQUIREMENTS:

*** Python 2.7.6 or greater
*** PIL, Tkinter, PyCrypto, hashlib, binascii libraries
*** A decent computer.

COMMENTS:

12/19/2014 - Remember, I'm a mathematician, so the code could probably look
prettier.  However it runs cleanly.

12/20/2014 - The GUI could be better.  Tkinter is decent but not very pretty
to look at.  Additionally, I have incorporated an encrypted image viewer
that works, but I'm having some difficulty making it viewable pretty in the 
GUI.  It takes the encrypted file, hexifys it to ascii, removes all of the
letter characters and replaces them with random number, then reconstructs an
image using the same dimensions as the original image.  This in fact works,
so that is not the problem.  The problem is making it look pretty in the GUI.
Maybe one day I'll actually incorporate this into the GUI.

12/21/2014 - Here is an example of an image before encryption, and then an 
image reconstructed from the crypto bitstream binary.  Seeing this reconstruction
is disable in the GUI because I haven't yet found a pretty way to display it.
However if you uncomment out the encim.show() in line 131 you'll get an image
reconstruction from the crypto bitstream binary.  This is completely optional.
